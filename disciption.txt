#pde1d

pde1d is intended to be an experiment/demonstration of partial differential equation numerical methods.
It includes dynamic plotting of partial differential equations as they are being solved.  Various numerical methods can be chosen including Runge-Kutta, Euler Explicit, Finite Element, Spectral, Least Squares.  Currently only linear advection with periodic boundaries is fully implemented.  Partial implementation for diffusion and Burgers equation exist.

##Controls

There is a PDE selection which currently includes linear advection/wave equation, linear diffusion, Inviscid and Viscus Burger's Equation.

Add new solvers with the combo box.  To remove a solver close its tab.  Each solver tab has a title which shows up on the tab, plot legend and Error Table.  Also each solver tab has a color chooser to select the color on the plot.

Also on controls tab are:
* Number of Points - the number of point and intervals to use
* Number of Cycles - Can be partial cycles to introduce a discontinuity in the initial condition
* CFL - Effectively the time step, CFL = c* Dt / Dx : note: wave speed = c = 1
* Viscosity - note: for stability consider viscosity * CFL / Dx
* Time Steps - Time steps to solve
* Plot Increment - update plot each plot increment steps.  Setting Plot Increment = Number of Points / CFL will replot full cycles of ideal solution to show how the error is changing.
* Plot Delay - extra delay added to slow animation in milliseconds
* Save Image - will save an image of the current window including visible tabs and error table
* Save Plot - saves the current plot possibly in a vector format, *.svg, *.ps, or *.pdf.
* Reset - resets all value to the initial conditions - works while running
* Run - start solving the equations
* Stop - interrupt the solution

##Solvers

The solvers are broken into primary and secondary solvers.

1. Euler Explicit - first order up-wind differencing
2. Least Squares Plus (LSP) - A least squares fit of the new time solution
    * Choice of Linear or Raised Cosine basis functions 
    * Implicit = degree of implicitness in time integration (0=explicit, 1=full implicit)
3. Simple Implicit - A tri-diagonal implicit finite difference solver.
    * Implicit = degree of implicitness in time integration (0=explicit, 1=full implicit)
    * Upwinding = shifts central difference to first order upwind
    * Note: Implicit =0 and Upwind = 1 is the same as Euler Explicit
4. Finite Element Method (FEM)
    * Implicit = degree of implicitness in time integration (0=explicit, 1=full implicit)
    * Linear or Raised Cosine Basis Function
5. General Implicit - Choices of FEM and LSP with Central or Adams-Molton 3rd Order time integration
    * Choice of Linear or Raised Cosine basis functions
    * Implicit = degree of implicitness in time integration (0=explicit, 1=full implicit)
    * Backward = coefficient on n-1 for time integration (Backward = -1/12,Implicit = 5/12 is third order)
    * note: only LSP is stable for CFL < 0.91 at third order
6. Explicit Runge Kutta - Runge-Kutta methods using Butcher Tableau
    * Mid-Point - 2nd Order
    * Trapezoid - 2nd Order
    * RK4 - Traditional 4th order Runge Kutta
    * Arb-RK-4 - Arbitrary Order Multi Stage method (excludes explicit time dependents in right hand side) set to 4th order
    * RKG-4 - Runge Kutta Gill 4th order method using Butcher Tableau
    * TVD-RK-3 - Third order method reported to be less oscillatory. TVD = Total Variation Diminishing  
    * Choice of Linear or Raised Cosine basis as well as finite difference with central or 4th order
7. Envelope - does not work well - to be replaced with spectral patch method
8. Spectral FFT - Performs a Fourier transform then updates in the frequency domain 
    * LSP - Least Squares Plus
    * FEM - Finite Element Method
    * RK-Mid Pt - Mid Point Runge-Kutta
    * RK-Trap - Trapezoidal Runge-Kutta
    * RK4 - Traditional 4th order Runge-Kutta
    * Arb-RK4 - Arbitrary Order Multi-Stage set to 4th order
    * Phaser - full explicit update in polar coordinates - update phase and magnitude at each frequency
9. Pseudo Spectral - Transforms flux function to update in the frequency domain
    * LSP - Least Squares Plus
    * FEM - Finite Element Method
    * RK-Mid Pt - Mid Point Runge-Kutta
    * RK-Trap - Trapezoidal Runge-Kutta
    * RK4 - Traditional 4th order Runge-Kutta
    * Arb-RK4 - Arbitrary Order Multi-Stage set to 4th order
    * Phaser - full explicit update in polar coordinates - update phase and magnitude at each frequency

##Error Table

The error table shows error values after the solution has been stopped. 
Note: if an ideal solution is not available errors are differences to the first stable solver

* Max Error - Maximum difference between ideal and solved values
* RMS Error - Root Mean Squared Error sqrt( sum( err^2 )/N )
* Max Value - The Maximum of the solved value points
* Min Value - The Minimum of the solved points
* Total Variation - Total Variation of the solution = sum of the absolute value of the difference between adjacent points
